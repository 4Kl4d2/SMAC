# SMAC
Sourcemod Anti-Cheat

0.8.6.1 Initial Commit (9-1-2016)
-----------------
- Used latest 0.8.6.0 code as base (this included all GPL headers and such for SMAC team and CodingDirect LLC).
- Added ZPS support.
- Removed updater code/references. Updater will no longer be used by this fork of SMAC.
- Re-tabbed all code. 1 Tab = 4 whitespaces.
- Included all relevant extensions, translations, script files, and pre-compiled plugins
- Most of this version's modules were tested for ZPS except game specific ones. smac_cvars works, but if you use any fake clients/bots, it doesn't mesh too well.
